//! ripeg. Incremental packrat Parsing Expression Grammar in Rust.
//!
//! ripeg is a general purpose parser written in Rust, with a focus on accessibility, correctness,
//! and performance. It uses parsing expression grammar (or [PEG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar)) as input, which are similar in
//! spirit to regular expressions, but which offers the enhanced expressivity needed to parse
//! complex languages. Its incremental packrat parsing (optionnal) feature makes it very suitable for IDEs.
//! Regular expressions support is not planned.
//!
//! ## Getting started
//!
//! The recommanded way to start parsing with ripeg is to read the official [book](https://lwandrebeck.github.io/ripeg)
//!
//! Other helpful resources:
//!
//! * API reference on [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/ripeg)
//!

// Any PR emitting warnings when it comes to documentation wonâ€™t be accepted.
